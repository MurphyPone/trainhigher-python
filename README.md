Introductory Programming in Python Course

This course aims to cover several basic concepts for Python 3 including the following:

## 0. Working in REPL

## 1. Basic Programming Anatomy
- Variables, Assignments, & Statements

## 2. Variables & Types
- We can store information in variables
- numbers
    - int (whole numbers)
    - float (decimals)
- Strings
- lists

## (Break to Recap and Poll for Pacng, Feedback, Questions)

## 3. Basic Operators and Control Structures
- Arithmetic (think PEMDAS)
- Operators with Strings, Lists, and other types
- Control Structures
    - If/Then/\[Else\]
        - Conditionals:
            - `==`
            - `<=` 
            - `>=`
            - `!=` 
            - `not`, `and`, `or`
    - Loops:
        - While
        - For 
        - Advanced For loops (iterables)
- Data Structures (intro)
    - Lists
    - Sets
    - Maps
    - Classes

## 4. Functions
- Motivation (reausability, readibility)
- procedures (nor args)
- methods/functions (take args)

## 5. Data Structures
- lists
    - ordered
    - indexable
- dictionaries 
    - unordered key, value pairs 
    - fast

## 6. Classes
- Generally, we use classes to represent the composition of data 
- Make a person class
- Constructor
- self
